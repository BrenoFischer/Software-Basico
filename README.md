# Simple Fictional Language Parser

A 1 month project, to learn assembly and low level programming, for a course from **PUC-Rio college**.
Developed in C language, the program accepts a .txt file written in the "simple" fictional language. It parses the code from the file, saving on an array of bytes, representing the assembly language.


#### The Simple Language

The fictional language only contains:
  * ret (Return a variable or a const)
  * < (Variable assignment)
  * Aritmetics operations:
    * - 
    * +
    * *
  * iflez (jump)
